    <h1>Chapter 5: Programming Algorithms & Software Testing</h1>

    <h2>Phases of computer program development:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Understand the problem</li>
        <li>Design an algorithm to solve the problem</li>
        <li>Write the program code in an appropriate language based on the algorithm</li>
        <li>Enter the program and save</li>
        <li>Execute the program</li>
        <li>Test the program, find errors and debug, then retest</li>
        <li>Document and evaluate the program</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Programming structures:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Sequential structure: Top-down execution</li>
        <li>Decision structures: if/then/else</li>
        <li>Iterative (Looping):
            <ul>
                <li>while loop: continue looping as long something is true</li>
                <li>repeat/until loop: continue looping until something is true</li>
                <li>for loop: loop a given number of times</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Recursive structures:
            <ul>
                <li>Repeat a set of instructions as a subtask of itself</li>
                <li>Repetition continues until a degenerative case (base case) is met</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Two classic programming/database problems:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Sorting:
            <ul>
                <li>Descending order/Ascending order</li>
                <li>Sorting numbers</li>
                <li>Sorting strings (in accordance with ASCII values)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Searching: find specific data that meets a certain criteria
            <ul>
                <li>In database:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Filters: temporary search</li>
                        <li>Queries: search criteria are saved so they don't have to be recreated</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Two popular search techniques:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sequential search: search from top to bottom or bottom to top, one item at a time</li>
                        <li>Binary search: only works if data is SORTED first, start in the middle, then go to half of that, etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Two classic program goals:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Efficiency: Program takes minimal time and/or resources</li>
        <li>Correctness: Program runs in expected ways and works for all expected conditions</li>
    </ul>
