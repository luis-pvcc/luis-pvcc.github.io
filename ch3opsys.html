    <td colspan="2">Operating System</td>
    <td colspan="3">An <b>Operating System</b> is the software that controls the overall operation of a
        computer. It provides the means by which a user can store and retrieve files,
        provides the interface by which a user can request the execution of programs,
        and provides the environment necessary to execute the programs requested.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td colspan="2">Job Queue</td>
    <td colspan="3">In batch processing systems, the jobs residing in mass storage wait for
        execution in a <b>Job Queue</b>. A <b>Queue</b> is a storage organization in
        which objects (in this case, jobs) are ordered in FIFO.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td colspan="2">FIFO</td>
    <td colspan="3"><b>FIFO</b> (<b>First-in, First-out</B>) is, the objects are removed
        from the queue in the order in which they arrived. In reality, most job queues
        do not rigorously follow the FIFO structure, since most operating systems
        provide for consideration of job priorities. As a result, a job waiting in the job
        queue can be bumped by a higher-priority job.</td>
